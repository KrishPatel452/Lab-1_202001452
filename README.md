#  Objective 
##  Identifying the Functionl and Non-Functional Requirements

----

## 1. Identify FR and NFRs

### Functional Requirements:

    1. Book Borrowing and Returning: 
      - Members should be able to easily borrow and return books from their desk/chamber.
      - This allows for convenience and reduces the time and effort required to physically visit the library.
    2. Borrowing Date Extension:
      - Members should have the ability to extend the borrowing date if no other booking has been made for the same book.
      - This allows for more flexibility and eliminates the need for manual processes.
    3. Easy Book Transactions Handling:
      - The system should aid the library staff in handling day-to-day book transactions.
      - This makes their work more efficient and eliminates manual errors.
    4. Book Record Management:
      - The librarian should have the ability to enter and remove records for books in the system.
      - This allows for accurate record keeping and helps manage the library's collection.
    5. Online Book Browsing/Searching:
      - Non-members should be able to browse and search books online, but only members should be able to issue and return books. 
      - This allows for wider access to information while still maintaining control over physical book transactions.
    6. Web Application Deliverable:
      - The final deliverable should be a web application running within the institute LAN.
      - This makes it accessible to members and staff while reducing security risks associated with a web application accessible from the internet.
    7. User Management:
      - The System need to permit access from members, visitors, library employees at various levels of administrative levels.

 ### Non-Functional Requirements:

    1. Security: 
      - Confidential information (e.g. passwords) should not be stored in plain text and care should be taken to reduce the security risk of the software.

    2. Performance: 
      - The system should have a fast response time, low latency and efficient resource utilization.

    3. Usability: 
      - The system should be easy to use and provide a positive user experience, with clear user interface design and navigation.

    4. Reliability: 
      - The system should be stable and available, with minimal downtime and data corruption.

    5. Maintainability: 
      - The system should be easily maintainable, with clear code structure and documentation.

    6. Scalability:
      - The system should be able to handle increased load or demand, including the addition of new users and increased amounts of data as this system is going to used by Research scholars, Professors and a Large number of other employees.

## 2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

### Scope:

    - The Problem Scope is to develop a remedy for the 466 milion or around 5% of the world's population who are hearing impaired.
    - The objective is to develop a solution that notifies users instantly and continously logs important sound events of importance to this community.
    
### Features:

    - A mobile application that use artificial intelligence to identify significant sound events of interest to the hearing-impaired community serves as the answer.
    - The programme can identify and notify the user of certain sounds, including baby crying and car horns, that are crucial for the user to be aware of in the present.
    - The software operates in real-time since it is low latency and suited for Android.
    - The software offers ongoing logging of the recognised sound occurrences as well.
    
### Non-Functional Aspects
    - The app should have a low latency, so it can work in realtime and provide immediate alert to users.
    - App should be reliable by precise sound recognization and notifications.
    - App should be secure and guard users's privacy.
    - User must be able to add custom sounds, so that app can recognize it later.
